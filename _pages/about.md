[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-024-14372-3)
- A grasping pose estimation framework based on point cloud fusion and filtering is proposed, which solves the problem of sparse point clouds at object edges and facilitates more robust grasping.
- A novel pose estimation method based on viewpoint selection is introduced, which first uses an RGBD cam
era to reconstruct the point cloud model of the object, and then applies the principle of viewpoint selection to 
obtain the 6D pose of the object.
- We demonstrate that through pose estimation and point cloud fusion, this grasping framework can accurately grasp object from a single-view RGBD image, maintaining a high success rate even in cluttered scenes.

## Sampling Robots in Complex Environments

Because of the irregularities on the object's surface and variations in lighting conditions, point cloud images obtained from a single perspective often contain significant gaps and errors at the object's edges, which can lead to inaccurate grasping pose estimations. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a practical robot grasping method based on 6D pose estimation and point cloud fusion. First, 6D pose estimation is conducted, utilizing the results from model point cloud and pose estimation to complete the input point cloud through ICP (Iterative Closest Point). Subsequently, the resulting complete object point cloud is used to estimate the 6D grasping pose of the object with the help of the grasping direction estimation network.

</div><div markdown="1">

**Finished Works**:
1. Establish a model-free 6D pose estimation network based on perspective matching. Construct and train the pose estimation network to achieve precise pose estimation for seen objects and a rough estimation method for untrained objects. Create a pose refinement network for untrained objects when sparse point clouds are accessible.

2. Propose a point cloud fusion and filtering method based on pose estimation. This method addresses the issue of point cloud gaps at the edge of objects when the robot collects samples from a single perspective. The point cloud fusion method is designed to utilize the output of pose estimation to fill in the gaps in the input point cloud and remove noise.

3. Perform grasp pose estimation using the completed point cloud. Utilizing the grasping angle prediction network and a fast search strategy, the completed point cloud enhances the stability of grasping pose generation, thereby improving the success rate of grasping and its robustness.

4. Test the system in simulation and the real world using a 6DoF robot, a Realsense camera, and a laptop (ROS/Ubuntu 20.04) as the host computer.

Rock Core samples obtained from drilling before oil extraction are crucial data for assessing mining value, and they are stored in dedicated core boxes. During research and analysis, it's essential to arrange these rock core boxes neatly on-site in a designated order, one box at a time. However, these boxes are typically heavy, resulting in a high labor intensity that can impact transportation efficiency. The present invention aims to address the labor intensity associated with the current method of transporting core boxes, ultimately improving transportation efficiency.

**Finished Works**:
1. Build a sensing system that utilizes infrared sensors to detect surrounding obstacles, as well as fractional laser sensors to detect the current stacking height and alignment.

2. Implement rock core box instance segmentation based on Mask RCNN, combined with a depth camera to determine its corner space coordinates for visual servo during the robot handling process.

3. Utilize a monocular camera and Aruco markers to achieve 2D pose adjustment of the robot in place by identifying the offset distance and angle of the Aruco marker.

In traditional medical processes, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners often need to frequently change positions and adjust their angles to view the surgical area. Additionally, during rehabilitation treatment, the camera's range can be inadequate to cover the patient's moving area. Current recording methods commonly used suffer from limitations and lack automation. This article introduces a multi-degree-of-freedom pan-tilt system designed to track the positions of doctors and patients.

Monitoring essential information in various hazardous environments, such as petrochemical plants, chemical plants, and disaster sites, is vital for disaster prevention and reduction. In response to this need, our team has designed a spherical environment monitoring robot system. It features a spherical metamorphic structure with multiple telescopic feet that enable the robot to rotate, roll, and achieve all-round motion with high stability. These robots utilize self-organized network communication technology to offer multiple monitoring modes, and the collected data is packaged and transmitted to the upper computer system, enabling real-time dynamic monitoring of complex environmental information over a wide area.
